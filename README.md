# porcentage_language_dir

program for calculate porcentage of a programming language in a directory

inspirate by [gitgub linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/) but work in non-git directories

the list of languages is a CONST in the code(so edit it for add what you need)

not have dependecies for print porcentages

if a args -p or --plot will save a png pie chart using ```matplotlib```
